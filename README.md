# ArcCW - Arctic's Customizable Weapons

Welcome to the ArcCW GitHub page!

You are free to contribute by sending pull requests. For bug reports, please create an issue in this repo or reach out on Discord.

## Style Guide:
 - 4-space indents
 - "!" and "!=", not "not" and "~="
 - CamelCase for global/class variables, lowercase for local variables
 - (no spaces) inside parentheses
 - but (spaces) between them and other variables
 - Use fptje's Glualint -> https://fptje.github.io/glualint-web/ <- to detect other style issues. Basically I don't like when my glualint has lots of yellow squiggly lines on it.
