# ArcCW - Arctic's Customizable Weaponry

Welcome to the ArcCW GitHub page!

You are free to contribute by sending pull requests.

## Style Guide:
 - 4-space indents
 - "!" and "!=", not "not" and "~="
 - CamelCase for global/class variables, lowercase for local variables
 - (no spaces) inside parentheses
 - but (spaces) between them and other variables
 - Use fptje's Glualint -> https://fptje.github.io/glualint-web/ <- to detect other style issues. Basically I don't like when my glualint has lots of yellow squiggly lines on it.
